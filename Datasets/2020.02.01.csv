2020-02-29 05:57:53+00:00,3,Twitter for Android,1st plane from Wuhan landed in California on Jan 29 they were in quarantine for 14 days so Feb 13th? Now Feb 28th we have outbreaks of #coronavirus in ppl who have no travel history? ü§î Maybe they were NOT quarantined long enough? @MisterAntiBully
2020-02-29 05:57:50+00:00,0,TweetDeck,Hmm. Looks like China has a more similar climate to Wuhan than anywhere else in the world.

Same as in Wuhan, where the virus is said to have began. Speed of testing is only one measure of a good healthcare system. We‚Äôre still 12-18 months away from a vaccine if all goes well. U.S. is in the lead"
